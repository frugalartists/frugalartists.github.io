<p>
First things first, we - Frugal Artists - are humbled and honoured to be a part of this wonderful crypto/web3/blockchain/nft community. Thank you all for this great opportunity of a lifetime.

This is "CRYPTOCRACY". Similar in spirit to those primitive democracies thousands of years ago when people first started taking control of their lives.

Can anybody imagine how strange that might have sounded to the people who are used to the idea of tribes controlled by a powerful leader, or subjects under a monarch? Classic centralized society.

Yes, surely we can imagine as we have a fantastic example infront of us. All those who doubt crypto community just sound like those clueless people who couldn't understand the basic fact that change is inevitable.

<pre><code> Let's paraphrase Victor Hugo:
"Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come."

<p>We rest our case...</p>

<a id="project-motto" class="anchor" href="#project-motto" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Motto</h3>

<p>"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" is an ancient Sanskrit phrase which means "the world is one family".

Unfortunately we are a divided species. Divided by nations, religion, race, ideology, politics, language, gender, and the list goes on and on.

We are children of science and technology. We agree with the biology. Genetically, our whole human species is much more similar than most people like to believe.

We completely respect an individual's beliefs, no matter how different they are from ours, but then, we also belive, things that divides us are crime against the future of mankind.</p>

<a id="project-1" class="anchor" href="#project-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project 1: Unity in Multiplicity</h3>

<p>Unity in multiplicity, is our first NFT project with the underlying message of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam".

These 729 unique super rare NFTs representing all the communities divided by the biology but united by the love for humanity.

PS: All our projects will also have a certain percentage donations dedicated to different charities. Unity in multiplicity will donate 10% of all it's  earnings to UNAIDS program.</p>
